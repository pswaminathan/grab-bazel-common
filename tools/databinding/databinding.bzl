    """Generates Android library with Kotlin sources and Databinding support.

    This macro resolves circular dependencies that occur when using Databinding with Kotlin
    sources. It first compiles Kotlin code referenced in XML layouts using kt_jvm_library,
    then processes Databinding in android_library.

    Without this macro, a circular dependency occurs because:
    1. android_library needs Kotlin classes to process XML references
    2. Kotlin classes need generated Databinding classes
    3. Databinding classes can't be generated until android_library processes resources

    The macro breaks this cycle by:
    1. Processing resources without aapt to generate stub classes (R.java, BR.java, *Binding.java)
    2. Compiling Kotlin against these stubs
    3. Replacing stubs with actual classes in a final android_library

    Args:
        name: Name of the target.
        srcs: List of Kotlin and Java source files.
        custom_package: str, optional. Java package for generated R.java and BuildConfig files.
            If not specified, derived from the manifest's package attribute.
        manifest: Label, optional. Android manifest file.
        assets: List of files, optional. Asset files to include in the library.
        assets_dir: str, optional. Directory containing the assets.
        resource_files: List of Android resource files (layouts, drawables, etc).
            Must include any XML files that use data binding expressions.
        deps: List of targets, optional. Dependencies required by both Kotlin sources
            and Android resources.
        plugins: List of Kotlin compiler plugins, optional. Applied only to the Kotlin
            compilation phase.
        visibility: List of visibility specifications, optional.
        tags: List of tags, optional. Applied to both Kotlin and Android targets.
